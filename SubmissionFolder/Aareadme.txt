Dear sir,
Greetings!
After the final evaluation of our project, as you preferred using structures in the code, 
we included most of the game components, such as, Tom, Jerry, the wall, coins, and the bigger
coins as structured objects.
We also included some features for more colors!
Thank you for your kind supervision and guidance throughout the project as well as the course.
